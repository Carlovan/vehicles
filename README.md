# Vehicles
Some experiments with autonomous agents and vehicles.

## Build
This project uses CMake and Conan, so you must first install those.

Then you can simply:
1. Create a `build` directory and enter it
2. Run `cmake ..` to generate the config
3. Run `make` to actually build the sources

You'll get a `Vehicles` executable in the `build` directory.
